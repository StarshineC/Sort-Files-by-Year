# Sort-Files-by-Year
We needed to sort a bunch of pictures by year so I made this.

# How to use

1. Open input.txt
2. Paste the path of the folder you want everything to be sorted into in the first line.
3. Paste a list of paths you want in the next lines.
4. Leave the last line empty
5. If you're using Windows, replace all "\" with "/".
6. Open the executable.

# EXAMPLE input.txt CONTENTS
```
C:/[Censored for Demonstration]/out
C:/[Censored for Demonstration]/in
C:/[Censored for Demonstration]/otherIn

```
